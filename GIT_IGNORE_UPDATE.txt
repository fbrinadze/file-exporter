GIT IGNORE UPDATE
=================

WHAT WAS UPDATED
----------------

The .gitignore file now excludes:

1. BUILD FOLDERS
   - build/
   - dist/

2. DISTRIBUTION FOLDERS
   - File_Exporter_Distribution/
   - File_Exporter_Distribution.zip

3. EXECUTABLE FILES
   - *.exe (Windows)
   - *.app (macOS)
   - *.dmg (macOS disk images)
   - *.msi (Windows installers)
   - *.deb (Linux Debian packages)
   - *.rpm (Linux RPM packages)

4. PYINSTALLER FILES
   - *.spec
   - file_exporter.spec

WHY THIS MATTERS
-----------------

✅ Keeps repository clean
✅ Reduces repository size
✅ Prevents binary files in version control
✅ Only source code is tracked
✅ Each developer builds their own executables

WHAT TO COMMIT
--------------

DO COMMIT:
✓ Source code (.py files)
✓ Documentation (.md files)
✓ Configuration templates (.env.example)
✓ Build scripts (.bat files)
✓ Requirements (requirements.txt)

DON'T COMMIT:
✗ Executables (.exe, .app, .dmg)
✗ Build folders (build/, dist/)
✗ Distribution packages
✗ Personal settings (.env)
✗ PyInstaller specs (*.spec)

REMOVED FROM GIT
----------------

The following were removed from git tracking:
- build/ folder and all contents
- dist/ folder and all contents
- file_exporter.spec

These files/folders still exist on your computer,
but git will no longer track changes to them.

NEXT STEPS
----------

1. Commit the updated .gitignore:
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Update .gitignore to exclude build artifacts"

2. Build executables locally:
   build_exe.bat

3. Executables won't be tracked by git anymore

SHARING EXECUTABLES
-------------------

Since executables are not in git, share them via:
- Email attachments
- Network drives
- File sharing services (OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)
- Release packages (GitHub Releases, etc.)

Each developer should build their own executable
from the source code using build_exe.bat
