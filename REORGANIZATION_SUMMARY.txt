   ✓ Changed: from email_notifier import ...
   ✓ To: from includes.email_notifier import ...

3. CLEANED UP .SPEC FILES

BENEFITS
--------

✅ Better Organization
   - Notification modules grouped together
   - Cleaner root directory
   - Clear separation of concerns

✅ Scalability
   - Easy to add more modules to includes/
   - Can add other folders (utils/, config/, etc.)
   - Professional project structure

✅ Cleaner Git
   - .spec files excluded
   - Only source code tracked
   - No auto-generated files


WHAT .SPEC FILES ARE
--------------------

PyInstaller creates .spec files when building executables.
They contain build configuration and are auto-generated.

Why we don't need them in git:
- Auto-generated each build
- Can be recreated anytime
- Clutter the repository
- Not needed for source code


TESTING
-------

Test that everything still works:

1. Run from source:
   python file_exporter.py

2. Test notifications:
   python test_notifications.py

3. Build executable:
   .\build_exe.bat


IMPORT CHANGES
--------------

Old imports:
  from email_notifier import send_success_notification
  from teams_notifier import send_failure_notification

New imports:
  from includes.email_notifier import send_success_notification
  from includes.teams_notifier import send_failure_notification


NEXT STEPS
----------

1. Test the application:
   python file_exporter.py

2. If everything works, rebuild the .exe:
   .\build_exe.bat

3. Commit the changes:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Reorganize project structure"


PROJECT IS NOW CLEANER AND MORE ORGANIZED! ✨
